Credits
=======

The initial inspiration and core migration logic comes from the 
`trac-to-gitlab <https://github.com/moimael/trac-to-gitlab>`_ project by
`MaÃ«l Lavault <https://github.com/moimael>`_: this project was born from
heavy cleanup and refactoring of that original code, so this is why this spinoff
inherited its `GPLv3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_ license.
